INTRODUCTION. 
In this country clinical examinations of the blood 
have hitherto been employed almost exclusively by the 
Physician, and generally in those conditions known 
as "Diseases of the Blood." 
In American and Continental Hospitals haematological 
examinations have been adopted as a clinical method 
with a much wider application. We now know that such 
examinations can give information to the physician in 
diseases other than diseases of the blood, and further, that they can be of the greatest value to the sur 
geon. Quite three fourths of my observations upon 
this subject have been made upon surgical cases, and 
none of the medical cases I have examined were suffer 
ing from any of the so- called "Diseases of the Blood." 
It is the blood which sustains the vitality of every 
organ in the body. Through it the products of constructive and destructive metabolism are carried to 
their respective destinations, therefore it ought not 
to be surprising that a careful examination of its 
. several elements should prove of value to the clinici 
an. The necessary technique for such examinations 
has been improved very considerably during the last 
ten years, and a very satisfactory degree of accuracy 
can be claimed for our results at the present time. 
We owe a very great deal to men like Ehrlich, Thoma, 
- 2 - 
Hayern, and many others, not only for their great scien 
tific genius, their emphatic pathological conclusions 
and their brilliant histological results, but also 
for that scientific accuracy and,untiring perseverance 
which cannot fail to bear fruit in the younger generation of scientific workers. 
A complete examination of the blood occupies so much 
time that it is almost impossible for the busy practitioner to carry it out with any degree of regularity.With 
this feeling in my mind, I have worked at the subject 
of leucocytosis in order to determine how much information is likely to be obtained by such a partial examina 
tion of the blood as simple quantitative estimation 
of the white blood corpuscles. Every medical practitioner accustomed to the use of the microscope, will 
have no difficulty in counting leucocytes, and it can 
be done in so short a time that it ought to be possible 
to the busiest of us. 
Compared to leucocytes the erythrocytes are much less 
liable to rapid changes in their numerical value. It 
is true that in diseases such as Pyaeinia, Septicaemia, 
and the like, we get moderately rapid decrease in the 
red corpuscles of the blood, but even here it takes 
days and even weeks, to produce a relatively large diminution. With leucocytes it is very different; we 
- 3 - rarely observe leucopenia in any disease; it is generally a leucocytosis. This increase occurs with great 
rapidity, so much so,that in certain pathological condo 
tions the number of white blood corpuscles may have 
been multiplied several times within a few hours of the 
onset of the disease. After effective treatment has 
been adopted, the return to normal again may be corres, 
pondingly rapid. Such a leucocytosis must have some 
clinical significance, and some definite purpose to 
serve. Its great constancy in certain diseases pre - eludes the possibility of its being accidental or a mere coincidence. We cannot but regard leucocytosis 
as an established clinical phenomenon, occurring and 
disappearing under definite conditions. The charts I submit for observation will show that the leucocyte 
curve is as positive in its value as that of the temperature or- pulse. 
Examinations of the temperature. pulse. and urine, are 
quite as necessa y to the surgeon as they are to the 
physician. They supply valuable information in the 
great majority of clinical conditions, whether medical 
or surgical; in certain cases their assistance is 
much greater than in others. In all clinical work 
heat value and pulse rate are watched and charted with 
the greatest regularity. The clinician knows by experi 
- 4 - ence of their great value in diagnosis: he has learned 
to rely on their information, and to regard them as honored and well tried physical signs. Their careful 
record has prevented many mistakes in diagnosis, spared 
many needless days of anxiety to the medical man, and 
indeed been the means of saving many a patient from an 
early ;rave. 
In like manner, I feel sure that regular estimation of 
the leucocytes would be of great value to the medical 
practitioner. The same frequency of examination is not 
necessary, such would involve too much of his time, but 
he would be amply repaid for the little additional trou 
ble that moderately regular leucocyte counts would incur. It is the surgeon who will in all probability obtain the most information from regular estimations of 
the white blood corpuscles. 
We have long known of the amoeboid movements of leucocytes, of their phagocytit action, of their special se- cretory qualities, and the important part they play in 
all inflammations. It is therefore a trifle surprising 
that their careful examination has not been adopted by 
the surgeon earlier. 
Much has already been done to show that regular haemato 
logical examinations are worthy of the utmost attention. 
Their assistance in the diagnosis and prognosis of 
- 5 - 
certain diseases apart from blood diseases proper, ha$ 
been proved beyond a doubt. I feel confident that thé 
day is not far distant when it will be a regular routine, both in hospital and private practice, to make a: care ful examination of the leucocytes in a large group 
of clinical cases. If this were done with the same regularity as we examine the temperature and pulse, many ui 
diagnosed conditions which are revealed in the postmortem room, would be discovered in life, and success -! 
fully dealt with. 
1`?o single clinical method - or physical sign - can he 
regarded as infallible, and I do not for one moment 
wish to imply that the examination of the leucocytes is 
an all important one. 
I wish it to be considered in conjunction with other 
physical signs, and if such is done, I think it will 
prove to be a valuable adjunct to our present clinical! 
methods. A perfect clinical picture is obtained by 
the care ful study of the numerous symptoms and physiÍ cal signs which a complete clinical examination re- veals. For the success of such a picture however, a very accurate sense of proportion is absolutely neces 
:sorry. A blood examination reveals to the clinician 
a part of that picture, - in some cases its revelation 
'is greater than in others, and it is only by prolonged 
6 experience, by repeated records, that such can be inter 
preted aright. I have striven at all times to pursue 
my investigations with a perfectly open mind. I have 
never allowed the current opinions as to the condition 
of a patient to influence my results. 
During my observations I have made upwards of 1500 leucocyte counts, practically all of which were furnished 
by cases in the Birmingham General Hospital. In many 
of my cases I counted the red corpuscles and estimated: 
the amount of haemoglobin, but I have purposely omitted 
to record the results of these examinations in order to 
prove if possible that the examination of the leucocytes 
alone is a clinical method of the greatest value. 
Seeing then that this limited examination of the blood' 
is so simple, involving such a small expenditure of 
time, and certainly within the capacity of every busy 
practitioner, I hope that these records may in some measure tend to stimulate young practitioners of my own 
school to work at this subject and decide for themselves 
its true clinical value. 
All the bacteriological examinations mentioned were 
carried out in the pathological laboratory of the General Hospital. These bacteriological reports have been 
introduced into this paper, merely to throw further 
light upon the particular case of suppuration, meningi- 
7 
tis etc. whose blood I was investigating. Pulse rate 
per minute, respiratory rate per minute, and degree of 
temperature were taken from the chart by the bedside 
of each patient. They represent the highest point 
reached by temperature pulse and respiration at any 
time during the day upon which the corresponding leuco 
cyte count was taken. They have been placed in the re cord to show as briefly as possible the general state 
of the patient and further to bear comparison with the 
simultaneous position of the leucocyte curve. Operations and post mortems were generally witness by me in 
person, failing which,' copied from the 
Oreration and Post Mortem hooks respectively. I saw sections of all the tumours spoken of in the record. 
Anaesthetics were copied from the anaesthetic book. 
To the Honorary Staff of the Birmingham General Hospi-, 
tal I am deeply indebted for the ready consent they 
gave to me in pursuing my observations, and for the 
great interest they manifested in my results. To the 
Resident Staff I tender my sincere thanks for the many 
facilities they afforded me, by reporting cases soon 
after admission in which I was specially interested. 
I should before proceeding to results sifirst like to 
emphasise several points in the technique of leucocyte; 
- 8 - counting. 
The haemocytorneter used was the Thotna- Zeiss. I possessed several white pipettes, which enabled me to et 
through my daily observations more_ rapidly. The popular 
idea that the glass ball in the bulb of the Thorua -Zeiss 
is a source of error,due to adherence cf leucocytes, 
can I think be overcome by thorough cleanliness. It 
was my habit to run through my pipettes a quantity of 
strong nitric acid every few days, and digest them every 
week in dilute Hydrochloric acid and pepsin. 
Thisweekly routine is of course quite unnecessary to a man who is using his pipette less frequently. 
Having the pipette perfectly dry so that the glass ball 
moves freely, is an essentiel condition before any ex- amination can be made. 
The best strength of diluting fluid is 3% or 5% of 
acetic acid, in this whi to corpuscles will remain quite 
well preserved for twenty four or forty eight hours. 
The addition of ietbyl Violet gives little or no advantage, and it stains the pipettes. Stronger solutions 
of acetic acid disintegrate the white corpuscles, so that it is impossible to keep a full pipette long before making a count. It is further apt to produce 
clumping or balling of the leucocytes, e. condition 
Which entirely disqualifies any result. If the solu- 
9 
tion is too dilute, it is apt to prevent the necessary 
Taking of the red corpuscles and renders the counting 
of leucocytes very difficult. 
The needle used for the puncture c -, ght to have a perfect point, a hagedorn, or a large triangle is very 
good. It is possible to take the blood from a sleeping child by a good needle,without waking it. Gentle 
rubbing of the lobe of the ear with sterilised wool 
is quite sufficient precaution to take before the prick 
is made. 
The blood must on no account be expressed from the 
puncture. This produces a local cyanosis which is suf 
f i c ient to unduly increase the corpuscular value of 
the drop expressed. 
A dilution of 20 times is the most useful one in counting the white blood corpuscles, as met with in diseases 
apart from leucocythaemia. Should .01 air bubble accidentally enter the pipettes the pipette should be 
cleaned again, and the whole process repeated. The best 
way to clean a pipette is to run it through with distilled water, then absolute alcohol and finally methylated ether, which is blown out by an ordinary ball air 
pump, a stream of air being continued for some time Un 
til the glass ball rolls freely in the cavity of the bulb. 
The blood should never be allowed to dry in a pipettes 
- 10 - 
I was in the habit of cleaning my pipette directly 
the count was made. If such a :a sfortune should happen 
nothing can be done but by digesting the dry blood out 
of the pipette by dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin. 
In diluting the blood after the exact amount has entered 
the pipette, vigorous suction is of ajvantage at first, 
because it sweeps the blood up from the barrel of the 
pipette into its bulb where the mixing alone takes 
place. When mark 11. is exactly touched by the mixture it is advisable to shake the pipette thoroughly in 
order to mix the blood so that if a drop or two should 
fall out in carrying it to the microscope the result 
is not spoiled. This spilling however can be avoided 
by holding the pipette horizontal. I always agitated 
my pipette in several directions for two minutes. The 
drop for examination was always taken from about the cen tre of the bulb,by driving out half of the blood, and I always made two counts from the same pipette. These 
were nearly always of the sane numerical value; should 
they differ I made a third count and took the average 
of the two most nearly approximated. Newton's rings 
must always be seen on the cover slip before the count 
is made. It is very necessary to cleanse the slide and 
cover slip carefully from time to time with absolute alco 
hol and ether. , Air bubbles over the ruled space quite 
spoil a result, so that when this occurs, new drops 
must be counted. 
T have not attempted to describe the general routine 
of my method, because in other respects it was identical 
with that given in text books. I feel very confident 
that provided a careful and rigid technique is adhered 
to,a very satisfactory measure of accuracy can be obtained by this instrument. If a man persistently uses 
all precautions against e rrorirejecting examinations in 
which he knows there have been mistakes, he will 
be amply repaid by the universal results he obtains from 
day to day. 
Nearly all my observations upon patients were made 
between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Breakfast was at 6 a.m. din -! her at 12. 30 p.m. so that digestion leucocytosis was 
as far as possible eliminated. I regarded the normal 
leucocyte count as anything between 5000 and 10,000 
per cubic millimetre. 
I made my films for staining upon specially prepared 
glass slides by means of cigarette paper. The end of 
the cigarette paper is allowed to touch a tiny drop of 
freshly drawn blood, the paper is held by the other end. 
This is transferred to the glass slide quickly, the 
drop spreads out in a thin layer between the paper and 
the slide. I t is then dragged delicately down the

length of the slide, leaving a .thin film in its rear. After a little practice, very beautiful films'can be obtained by this method. The film should be labelled at. 
once. Most of my films were fixed by heat in the dry 
steriliser. The heat I liked best was from 105 degrees 
to 110 degrees centigrade for one hour. The high temp 
eratures of 140 to 150 centigrade recommended by Cabot, 
were not successful in my hands. After fixing with 
heat, I invariably used Ehrlich's tri acid stain. At 
the commencement of my investigations I had great diffi 
culty in obtaining a good tri -acid mixture, and I was 
compelled to change it several times before my results 
were satisfactory. There can be no question about the 
brilliance of this stain, provided you fix with the 
eight degree of heat; you cannot overstain with it. 
Your mistakes come in the fixing not in the staining. 
I am not however prepared to call it a perfect stain by 
any means. Its color effects are indeed lovely, but its 
definition is not so perfect as the cosine and methylene 
blue mixture. The. nuclei do not stain so deeply with 
the tri acid mixture, and their outline is not so distinct as When stained with eosine and methylene blue. 
In making my differential counts upon the fatal cases of 
pneumonia I had very great difficulty in distinguishing 
the exact outline of nuclei, a matter of very great im-

- 13 - portance in differentiating rnyelocyt es from poly nuclear 
cells. Ehrlich's mixture is a very brilliant granular 
stain. It is this feature Which .largely accounts for the 
imperfect definition of the nuclei in preparations stained' 
by: it. I had difficulty occasionally in decidin #_, wheth 
er a cell was a .coarsely ,ggranular oxyphile (eosinophile) or a finely granular oxyphile '(neutrophile)' 
the stain seemed to bring out cells that w ere transitional between the two. This may be a recomi endation 
for it, but in the light of our present classification 
of leucocytes it is nevertheless very disconcerting in 
making differential counts. With my films fixed in 
formalin vapor, and stained with eosine and methylene 
blue, I had fairly good results, the definition of indi 
vidual cells was better than in the Ehrlich films, 
and Ì had no such difficulty in distinguishing eosinophiles from so- called neutrophiles. My results, by 
the eosine and methylene blue method, were more universal than by the Ehrlich .rnethod..5 A good: Ehrlich is 
better however than a good eosinó- methylene blue specimen. For general practitioner, I should recommend 
the simpler method of fixing the formalin vapor and 
staining with eosine and methyl ¡ne blue. To obtain a good Ehrlich film, fixation by heat is almost essentials 
a method which is not easy in private practice, even 
- 14 - with improvised methods. 
My record will give the result of something: like 100 
differential counts. In doing qualitative estimations 
I used a Zeiss microscope with one sixth objective, a Ho. 6 compensating eye piece, with the draw tube half 
eftended. If there was any doubt in my mind concerning a corpuscle I turned on the oil immersion lens, 
and examined it more carefully. 
Much of the ground I have covered in these investigations has been worked at by other observers, so that 
I wish in no way to claim originality where such is 
not deserved. 0bservationsupon the leucocyte record 
during wound healing, fractures and strangulated hernia 
have as far as I know, not hitherto been made. 
My method of following up cases of appendicitis, pneumonia and suppuration of all kinds, is to my knowledge 
unrecorded elsewhere, and the clinical value of a regular daily examination in such cases has not I think 
been strongly advocated. I am deeply indebted to books 
by nabot, Ehrlich and Lazarus;- to articles by Muir, 
Stewart Macdonald, Stengl, Thayer, Sherrington, and 
many others for the valuable suggestions I have received 
from them, and for the keen interest their works have 
knvoked in me towards this subject.

The rising count in this case from norrrmal, suggests lahe 
probability that this case was admitted with a simple non 
suppurative appendicitis, and that pus was subsequently 
formed. 
A rising leucocytosis generally calls for operative 
treatment, The temperature, pi.rlse and respiration 
were perfectly normal in this case, despite the fact 
of suppuration. 
His local condition according to the notes did not 
suggest suppuration; such a case proves very forcibly 
the value of a leucocyte count, because though all the 
cardinal symptoms and signs of suppuration were absent 
the leucocyte record pointed strongly to it. 
His post -operative progress was very satisfactory. He

This case was regarded as a catarrhal appendicitis, 
without suppuration. The leucocytosis is not a high 
one, indeed it is the lowest I have ever found in sup - purative appendicitis. It is however a rising-; count, 
and it proves the value of consecutive examinations. 
.The temperature and pulse on admisd.ion were high; this 
us probably due to the shaking caused by her journey

In this case a leucocyte count was of the very greatest value in excluding typhoid. A Widal reaction is also of value, but a patient with appencicitis might have 
had typhoid a few months or years previously, and give. a positive reaction. Then again the Widal test cannot 
be relied upon until a patient has been ill five 
days. A leucocyte count would give information wheth -I 
er a patient had suffered from typhoid or not, and 
within a day or two of the commencement of the attack. 
The high leucocytosis on the day following operation 
was probably due to increased absorption of positively', 
chemiotactic toxin by the freshened walls of the abscess to a less extent perhaps by the loss of blood 
and the influence of the anaesthetic. 
It will be observed that the after progress was very 
slow in this case. He discharged freely for a considerable time. His leucocyte curve fell very slowly, in 
striking contrast to so many of my cases. The drainage in this case, owing to the position of the abscess, 
- 21 - 
could not have been good, and this is a complete ex- planation of the slowly diminishing leucocytosis.

to the utmost anxiety. His leucocytosis, though moderately high, was very fitful. It ebbed an d flowed, 
keeping accurate time with the varying amounts of discharge and the degree of its retention. 
After July 19th it suddenly fell to normal, and from 
about this time his recovery was assured.

This case was steadfastly regarded by the surgeon as a non -suppurative one, and on August Gth he decided to 
operate because the leucocyte record clearly pointed to 
the reverse. His leucocytosis on admission was to some extent due to the disturbance of his journey to Hospital 
It fell on the second day to its correct reading , from 
which point it gradually increased, and it was this real 
increase which induced the surgeon to interfere. It 
proves the value of consecutive counts. Had the blood 
examination ceased after the second day of admissionlit 
would have given the false impression that the boy was 
improving; an opinion that was held by the surgeon 
in this case, until subsequent counts dispelled it. 
His temperature and pulse are fully in keeping with his 
true condition, even though the local symptoms were en- tirely negative. 
The great proportion of Poly nduclear finely granular 
oxyphiles is very characteristic. 
His recovery after operation was uninterrupted, as his 
blood counts fully corroborated.

His very high count on admission is perhaps to some ex- tent due to his journey. It gives the typical differential count. His temperature and pulse on this day 
were normal, despite his large abscess. 
His after progress was most satisfactory, it drained 
well, and was practically healed by August 25th.

This case was of special interest. It was admitted 
to the Medical Wards, and regarded as a case of simple 
catarrhal appendicitis. I commenced my blood count 
on the day of admission, and on the following day, finding that it was a rising count, I gave it as my opinion 
that pus was present, and suggested the advisability 
of a surgical opinion. This suggestion however was not 
acted upon until September 8th. A rising count such 
as this is almost an infallible indication of increasing suppuration. His after progress was uneventful; 
the leucocyte numeral fell steadily in accordance with 
his rapid recovery. Note the normal temperature and

Another case in which the leucocyte estimation was 
of the greatest value. Nothing could be discovered by palpaticn; 
his temperature and pulse gave little or no assistance. 
The surgeon, a man of great authority upon this subject, could not satisfy himself that pus was present. 
It is but anotherimample of the greater relative sen- sitiveness of the leucocyte record to pulse and temperature in suppurative'appendicitis. It presents to us 
the leucocytosis of a fairly large abscess,well shut 
off, sending out an almost fixed amount of positvely 
chem otactic toxin from day to day. 
The after progress of the case, except for a slight 
hitch on the fifth day, is very satisfactory. Such 
deeply situated collections of pus are not wont to 
drain so rapidly.

The interest of this case lies in his after progress. 
He drained well for a few days. His leucocyte count 
touching normal on the third day, a condition that has oc curred in nearly all my cases of gangrenous appendicitis. After this point we meet with a series of rises

, 
- 33 - and falls in the leucocyte curve. On two occasions 
pent up discharge was quite sufficient to explain this; 
after this' however I could discover no cause for the 
leucocytosis, and was beginning to suspect another collection of pus. On October 8th the mystery was cleared 
up in the shape of a plug of iodoform gauze which was 
fished up from the bottom of the round. How long 
this had been present, it was impossible to learn exactly, but it was a fortnight at least.

This case was obviously from the local condition present, one of suppurative appendicitis, there was no difficulty whatever as to the diagnosis. His progress 
after the operation was somewhat slow, he did not drain 
well, and it is interest to observe that his leucocytesis was maintained until a few days after the drainage 
tube was re- inserted. The temperature and pulse re- mained normal, in contrast to the blood count.

in spite of the entire absence of local symptoms. The 
temperature was normal, the pulse rapid. His subsequent career was somewhat chequered. The haemic record pointed to imperfect drainage, and the passage of 
a faecal concretion, which was probably lying for some 
time in the bottom of the wound on October 22nd. was 
quite sufficient to explain his fluctuating count. 
It rose again on September 26th, and we find that this 
was due to another concretion which was discharged on 
October 29th. 
His further progress was satisfactory, his temperature 
did not rise above normal after November 5th, and his 
wound rapidly healed.

Between the dates of December 4th and 12th, the boy 
passed through an attack of acute lobar pneumonia, 
with daily temperature of 104. 
This case was one of great interest. His leucocytosis 
prior to operation suggested suppuration. He appeared 
to progress very well for a day or two after operation, 
his temperature, pulse and leucocyte count touching 
normal on the third day. I did not take his count 
again for five days, whèn I found it showing a marked 
leucocytosis. This of course suggested re- accumulation or bad drainage. He then began to complain of 
pain higher up in his abdomen. The surgeon decided to 
explore his belly once more, and discovered a large abscess behind the hepatic flexure. From this point his

every way for about a fortnight. A day or two before 
his intended discharge from Hospital he developed acute 
lobar pneumonia. He began to ail about December 4th. 
I took a blood count on December 5th, and found a slight 
increase of the white corpuscles, this leucocytosis 
would no doubt increase very considerably, and I am 
sorry that I was unable to follow it up. On December 
12th the leucocytosis was still high after the crisis. 
The little fellow ultimately to everyone's delight got 
perfectly well, despite the heavy odds he had to contend with.

a little granulation tissue in its middle, which on cultivation gave a copious growth of Bacterium Coli,

n This case is one in which the leucocyte count is cer- tainly instructive. He gave a slight leucocytosis on 
- 44 - 
the first day of my observation, which disappeared 
entirely in a day or two. I had no hesitation in saying that there was no pus present. The differential 
count made, was that of normal blood, a fact of great 
interest. In the light of facts revealed at the operation I think I might safely feel that the leucocytosis 
present on October 13th, was of an inflammatory nature, 
due to the smouldering embers of an old pyogenic focus, which was gradually being extinguished. There 
was no actual pus present at the operation, the only 
evidence that there had been,was a small mass of granulation tissue in the middle of the mass of adhesion. 
The wound suppurated, and his recuperative power was 
low.

This case is full of instruction. The local symptoms of 
suppurative appendicitis were practically absent. She 
was admitted to a medical ward, and this explains the 
reluctance shown to secure surgical interference. However, the surgeon, even when called in, did not regard 
the case as a suppurative one. I had no doubt in my 
own mind. The temperature, pulse, and increasing leucocyte count early pointed to a definite suppuration. 
The reaction was vigorous, and the leucocytosis well 
marked. The gradual daily increase of white corpuscles 
is of the utmost significance, and cannot be disregarded. It is of interest to notice that for two days before the operation, the temperature was almost normal. 
This is very apt to give the false impression of improvement under such circumstances. The leucocyte curve 
maintains its steady ascent, according to the cord it ion 
present. It is not impossible to imagine that many 
cases of this kind are allowed to remain untouched, until a rupture of the abscess occurs, into the general 
peritoneal cavity, when operative measures are perhaps 
useless. A regular leucocyte count would obviate such a 
danger. 
The after progess of this case was not rapid, and although my blood examinations were not made with much 
II 
- 47 - 
regularity, it can be clearly observed by it alone, 
that there was some cause which prevented it falling 
as it ought to have done. 
Thinking there was imperfect drainage, the surgeon inserted the drainage tube once more. 
On January 18th the true cause of the slow progress 
became evident. A f8,eca1 concretion is quite sufficient to account for a moderate leucocytosis, and impede 
the healing of such a wound. Under such conditions, 
when the leucocytes did not fall to their normal quantitative value, a careful search for concretions at 
the bottom of a sinus would be of value.

This is the one exception to my otherwise positive record of constant leucocytosis in suppurative appendicitis. It was obviously a suppurative case, and yet my 
counts on the two days preceding operation were normal 
ones. Even after operation there was no slight rise in 
the leucocyte numeral, as is often the case; this may 
be due to the very mild operation, which consisted in 
the mere opening of an abscess which was already quite 
superficial. The patient was anaesthetised by ether 
which rarely ever seems to increase any existing leucocytosis. The pus was not examined for organisms, much 
to my regret. I was specially anxious to do this, but 
be ing unable to attend the operation, I requested the 
house surgeon to put me up a specimen in a sterilised 
capillary tube; this was unfortunately forgotten. 
It is to some extent a matter of speculation to attempt 
- 49 - 
to explain this one anomalous case. 
There was a chronic history - he had suffered from pain 
and tenderness for eight weeks, and his abscess was by 
no means Tf recent formation. 
The dense fibrous walls were no doubt a very effective 
barrier to the absorption Of septic toxines. This 
of course, a remote possibility that this was a tuberculous condition, and had I been able to attend the operation I could have satisfied myself as to whether septic organisms were present or not. His age is not the 
most suitable for vigorous leucocytic reaction. Children give the highest degrees of leucocytosis. 
It is possible also that the man might have some idio -- syncracy against the action of the usual positively 
o.hemdttactic toxin. 
The differential count shows no increase whatever in 
polyneuclear cells, indeed a fairly definite increase 
in the small lymphocytes is to be observed instead.

This case, beyond its negative value, brings out one or 
two interesting points. 
Chloroform was the anaesthetic used, and we see a moder_ 
ate leucocytosis lasting two or three days. On June 25 
the count suddenly rose to 15520, per c.!n. This might 
be due to two causes. Firstly - and less likely - a dose of liquorice powder on the evening of the 24th, 
which gave him a rather smart relaxation of the bowels, 
which generally causes increase in the corpuscular value of the blood. Secondly, a considerable degree of 
redness was noticed round one or two stitches on this 
day, with small abscesses. This combination of causes 
is amply sufficient to account for the sudden degree of 
leucocytosis. My technique was unlikely to be at fault, 
as I counted the blood more than once that day. The 
temperature rose on the same evening to 101. The stitches were removed, and the count fell to normal next day.

There was considerable doubt, clinically, whether 
this was a suppurative case or not. The blood count is 
quite opposed to an abscess formation. The appendix 
was occluded, and from the interior of the swollen 
distal end a copious growth of Bacterium Coli was obtained. 
The anaesthetic was gas and ether. The slightly plus 
blood count during the three days following operation 
is of little significance, and was probably due to 
blood clot in the wound, or peritoneal cavity.

There is moderate leucocytosis after the operation, 
which disappeared the following day. 
C O N C L U S I O N S. 
1. Leucocyte counts can be of the very greatest value in 
appendicitis. 
2. A leucocytosis lasting more than one day points very 
strongly to suppuration. 
3. A steadily increasing leucocytosis is always of grave 
significance, pointing to advancing mischief, which 
ought not to be disregarded. 
Even though the temr: eratu re and pulse are no rmal,and 
there be an entire absence of local symptoms, such an 
increasing leucocytosis is sufficient to justify operative interference. 
4. In suppurative appendicitis, leucocytosis is a much 
- 57 - 
more constant symptom than a rapid pulse, and a rapid 
pulse than an elevated temperature. 
5. The degree of leucocytosis cannot be relied upon to 
furnish correct information as to the amount of pus 
present, though generally a small abscess gives rise 
to slight leucocytosis, and a moderately sized abscess 
to a higher degree of leucocytosis. 
This leucocytosis is regulated probably more by the 
amount of toxin given out by the local lesion, and 
this must vary with the degree of resistance to absorp 
tion, as regulated by adhesions, as well as to the 
virulence of the special organism. 
Children and young adults give higher degrees of leucocytosis than older patients. 
6. An abscess, well shut off, will give rise to a persistent leucocytosis, which varies in degree from day to 
day, due to conditions it is very difficult to determine. 
7. . Simple catarrhal appendicitis does not give rise to 
leucocytosis. 
8. If a large abscess is well shut off by adhesions of 
several weeks' duration, it is possible to find a perfectly normal blood count, as in case2. 
It has been definitely proved that a normal quantitative leucocyte count is often found in those serious 
9. 
- 58 - 
forms of suppurative appendicitis, pointing to a grave 
prognosis. In case 22, no such anxiety ever arose. 
It is of interest to realise that such a leucocyte 
estimation can be obtained in such a condition, though. 
I do not think that this exception impairs the value 
of leucocyte estimation in the diagnosis of acute 
suppurative appendicitis. 
The leucocyte numeral taken on the first day of patient's hospital life is generally unusually high. This 
is in all probability due to the shaking and disturbance of the journey. 
A single count therefore is apt to be misleading, unless such circumstances are taken into account. 
10. Consecutive counts of two or three days give much more 
reliable information than for one day only, so that 
where a definite leucocytosis is maintained for that 
is eriod, one may take it that there is a condition of 
things present that rest in bed does not appear to improve. 
11. The opening of an abscess in this region often increases the leucocytosis for a day or two. This is 
specially the case where chloroform has been employed 
as an anaesthetic. After the abscess is evacuated, 
if the condition is draining properly, the leucocytosis gradually disappears within a few days, and the 
- 59 - 
count does not rise again. 
12. Should the drainage be bad, giving rise to pent up discharge, the leucocyte curve will rise again, and keep 
on fluctuating according '.o the amount of retained pro, 
ducts. 
13. The formation of a fresh abscess is accompanied by increasing leucocytosis. 
14. A piece of iodoform gauze in an abscess eavity, or a foetal concretion, gives rise to a maintained leucocytosis. 
15. A regular quantitative estimation of the white blood 
corpuscles can be of the very greatest value in giving 
information as to the postoperative progress of suppurative appendicitis. 
Should the leucocytosis not disappear within a few 
days, a careful examination of the local conditions 
present should be made, in order to find out the cause 
of that delay. 
16. In gases in which the appendix has sloughed off into the 
abscess cavity, the leucocytosis generally disappears 
in a few days, and does not reappear. 
17. Leucocyte counts ought to be of value in the differential diagnosis of appendicitis. 
auch affections as Typhoid fever, intestinal colic, 
biliary and renal colic, unattended by local inflamma- 
- 60 - 
tory conditions, floating kidney, impacted faeces, 
abdominal neuralgias, give rise to no leucocytosis.

Discharged freely until May 23. 
The discharge varied in quantity from day to day. Wound 
was healed on June 1st. 
The case is interesting because of its after treatment. 
The abscess did not drain very satisfactorily, owing 
- 62 - 
to its unfavorable position and the irregularity of its 
interior. His leucocyte count, after many minor fluctuations, according to the degree of retention of the 
dishharge, touched normal for the first time on May 
28th. Three days later it showed a slight rise, and 
even my last count is not altogether satisfactory. 
The wound was healed on June 1st, and he was soon walking about. Nevertheless in view of this terminal re- turn of a slight degree of leucocytosis, it is of interest to record that not long after his discharge he 
was readmitted to Hospital with all the aggravation 
of his primary condition.

Died August 4th. Post mortem revealed a large sub - phrenic abscess perforating diaphragm, and bursting 
into the left lung. Adhesions binding down appendix. 
This case, though pregnant with interest, is a somewhat tragic one. The case.had passed through an attack 
of catarrhal appendicitis a few weeks ago, and was said 
to have recovered under expectant treatment. Her temperature however did not clear up, and the surgeon, being unable to find any obvious cause, transferred her 
to a medical ward. 
She had no pain, no tenderness, and except for the temperature, there was absolutely no clue to her condition. 
My cultivations from the blood were all sterile. 
The general opinion held was that she was suffering 
from early pulmonary tuberculosis; a few raies at the 
base of the right lung appeared to confirm that opinion. Then it was that I made my first leucocyte estimation 
with the above result. The high leucocytosis present 
led me to the opinion that there was some deep - seated 
suppuration somewhere. There was no history or evidence of Pneumonia, otherwise I should have thought of 
- 64 - an unresolved condition. Such a leucocytosis dismissed 
the possibility of its being a pure tuberculosis. 
On July 19th the patient suddenly commenced to cough 
and expectorated nearly a pint of pus. After this one had little difficulty in saying that there was an abscess of the lung present, or some abscess communicating with the lung. 
Despite these symptoms and the opinion I ventured to 
express to the House Physician, she was sent to the 
Jaffray Hospital to convalesce. 
Her sudden death was not a surprise, and the post mortem revelations still less so. 
I think in the light of our present knowledge that if an occasional leucocyte count had been made in this 
case, during and after the attack of acute appendicitis, that the mischief would have been detected earlier, and her life probably saved.

Patient died about the middle of August. 
Post Mortem revealed a large ragged stone filling up 
the pelvis of the kidney, large quantities of pus lying 
amongst coils of small intestines and communicating directly with the pelvis of left kidney. Many small abscesses bound down by adhesions also, which in some 
places had ulcerated into the lumen of the gut. There 
was no trace of Phthisis. 
Hadáleucocyte counts been made in this case before the 
lumbar abscess was opened, it would have probably prevented the error of diagnosis that was made. Exploration of the kidney could not have been made at the time 
of the operation; and given a high leucocytosis with 
- 66 - such an abscess, this would have been done, because it 
pointed strongly to a calcul #us. It was regarded as 
a tuberculous condition, which, unless infected, gives 
rise to no leucocytosis. 
The patient had a sinus when I saw her first on July 
30th, from which there was little or no discharge. The 
abdominal pain was regarded as due to a tuberculous 
condition, and Phthisis had also been discovered. 
I had little doubt in my own mind that whether tubercle 
was the original disease or not, there was certainly 
pyogenic mischief present later. 
Her temperature record was very misleading. Her pulse 
rate was not charted regularly. The leucocytosis is 
a high one, and in the light of a post -mortem revelation, this is not to be wondered at. 
I expressed the decided opinion at the time that there 
must be some considerable focus of pyogenic mischief 
pent up somewhere. 
The differential count is that of an inflammatory 
leucocytosis.

This case was regarded by the surgeon in charge of it, 
as a non -suppurative one. After two consecutive counts 
I had very little hesitation in giving a different opinion. 
The incision made into the right iliac region on Aug - 24th missed the abscess which undoubtedly existed. 
Ether was the anaesthetic, and unless increasing suppuration had not been present, the leucocytosis would not 
have been an increasing one for two days. The evacuation of the pus affected the leucocyte numeral at once. 
His differential count is characteristic. Despite the 
was 
ulcer on his right foot two weeks ago, I inclined to 
regard this case as one of suppurative appendicitis, 
and not suppurative adenitis,

Post Mortem revealed a general suppurative peritonitis 
with large amount of pus in pelvis and left loin. 
This patient was extremely far spent on admission to 
Hospital, and I was surprised to find his leucocytosis 
so well marked. The explanation no doubt was that he 
had been making a vigorous fight against his toxaemia 
during the five days of his illness. 
It occurred to me that, given a bad case of general 
peritonitis with considerable leucocytosis, it might 
be a strong indication to adopt a more perfect method 
of drainage than was adopted in this case. It is reasonable I think to suppose , that in such a patient, 
given flushing or sponging, together with free drainage, in both flanks and middle line, to remove as much 
toxic product as possible, we would give hirn a much 
- 70 - 
better chance of coping with the large dose of toxin 
present. We know, by past experience, that in severe 
general peritonitis, giving a normal or subnormal leucocyte count, that the prognosis is of the very worst. 
The dose of toxin is practically a lethal one from the 
outset, and death is generally but a few hours distant. 
In such a case we cannot help realising that whatever is 
done the result is a foregone conclusion. In cases giving a more vigorous reaction, and a well marked leucocytosis, there is I think much m0re encouragement for making the operative measures as thorough as the patient 
will possibly stand. 
The fact that this patient lived so long after his operation which could not be of much value to him, is in keeping with his vigorous reaction.

Died, on September 5th, about two hours after 
my last count. 
Post -Mortem showed general suppurative peritonitis, 
secondary to appendicitis. 
About half a pint of pus was present in the left flank. 
This case bears out what I have been trying to enunciate in my last case. This boy was very ill also, though 
not exhibiting the same degree of collapse as the last 
case. 
The treatment was here more vigorous, and the result 
was, though ultimately fatal, distinctly more encouraging. 
In view of his steadily increasing count after the 
operation, I ventured to suggest to the surgeon that 
there was increasing mischief somewhere, probably in the 
left flank, and suggested a further operation, with 
drainage in this region. The general condition of the 
boy was good, and fully justified further operative 
- 72 - 
measures. The P.M. proved I think that my suggestion 
was by no means a worthless one. 
I think that future experience will teach us that even 
in General Peritonitis just as in local suppurative 
peritonitis that a regular blood count will be of the 
greatest value to us in indicating what line of treatment would be wise and judicious. 
It is to be observed that the last leucocyte numeral 
formed just before death, is lower than on the previous day, and I think this points to a lowering of the 
vital reaction. 
I have not in my experience met with any cases of increased leucocytosis due to the moribund state, where 
leucocytosis has previously existed.

This case was a satisfactory example of value a leucocyte count can be in diagnosis. The man had the facies

temperature was normal. The physician, a man of vast 
experience, was inclined to the view that it was one 
of commencing peritonitis. My normal count I think 
entirely dismissed such a possibility, seeing that the 
patient's constitutional condition was so good. Had 
it been a case of peritonitis of two days' duration, 
he would have given a marked leucocytosis.

Bile ceased to discharge on October 11th. 
There was a slight reaccumulation on October 23rd, 
which was drawn off by a trocar and canula. 
The bile which was drawn off on October 8th was perfect 
ly sterile , as shown by several cultivations on agar. 
Nevertheless it was sufficiently irritating to produce 
a definite leucocytosis and probably a serous peritonitis. No leakages in any of the bile passages could be 
discovered. Whether bile acts as a mechanical or 
chemical irritant it is not easy to determine. His 
leucocyte count did not touch normal until October 15. 
A small reaccumulation caused a slight increase of leucocytes on October 23rd. He made an excellent recovery. 
CONCLUSIONS ON GENERAL PERITONITIS. 
1. Whether serous or suppurative, there is generally 
a well marked leucocytosis. 
- 78 - 
I have not amongst my few cases any which illustrate normal or subnormal counts in those very 
grave forms of general peritonitis. 
Leucocytosis in a case of Peritonitis excludes 
the possibility of a pure tuberculous affection. 
2. If there is local accumulation of pus, in a general peritonitis, due to bad drainage, the count will 
increase. 
3. Should a definite leucocytosis exist in a case 
of general peritonitis it is an encouragement to 
the surgeon to be as vigorous in his attempts to 
remove the poison already present in the peritoneal cavity, as circumstances will allow. 
4. Sterile bile, free in the peritoneal cavity can 
give rise to a well marked leucocytosis. 
5. Estimation of the leucocytes might aid in the 
differential diagnosis of general peritonitis 
from such conditions ,as severe colic, malignant 
disease, if not very advanced, Phantom tumours, 
hysteria, all of which do not give rise to leucocytosis.

is 
This cased of striking interest. He was working comfortably until exactly two hours before my first count was 
taken, then whilst lifting a heavy weight, he felt his 
rupture descend by the side of his truss. He could not 
reduce it, and it commenced to give him severe pain immediately. He was admitted to hospital suffering from 
intense agony. Om finding a leucocytosis of 21000 in 
two hours after the onset of his strangulation, I was 
not a little surprised. The severity of the case is 
no doubt the main factor in explaining this rapid leucocytosis . The differential count brings out the fact that increase in white cells is due entirely to the addition of 
Poly neuclear finely granular oxyphiles. 
It is obvious in this case also how very slowly the leucocytosis disappears. Sixteen days after the operation 
it has not touched itslowest point of diminution, for 
being on low diet, it must have fallen lower than my 
last count on November 9th records.

Feb.25. 99.6. 112. 26. 32160 11 Operation revealed a strangulated loop of 
small intestine by an abnormal mesenteric 
band. 
This case was diagnosed as a localised peritonitis, due 
- 88 - 
to a perforated gastric ulcer; the high leucocytosis 
is not against that view. So that it is an example of 
the fact that in distinguishing between an acute inflammatory condition of the peritoneum, and an internal 
strangulation, a leucocyte count is of little value. 
C ONC LU SI ON S. 
It is perhaps unwise to draw many definite conclusions 
from such a small number of cases as I have recorded, 
but I think one or two facts are fairly well established. 
1. A Strangulated Hernia,gives rise to a very definite leucocytosis. Of this I am certain, not 
only from the above examples, but from other 
examinations I have made which are not recorded 
here. Such a leucocytosis is probably due entirely to an increase in the Poly- niuclear finely yanular oxyphiles. 
2. Such a leucocytosis may be very definite within 
a few hours of the onset of the strangulation in 
severe cases. 
5. It would appear that the amount of damage done 
to the viscera is the regulating factor in the 
degree of leucocytosis produced. 
89 - 
4. After relief of the stm.ngulation the leucocytosis disappears very slowly, often taking two 
or three weeks to reach the normal. This period 
is shorter in milder forms of strangulation 
than in severer forms. 
This is in very striking contrast to the rapid 
disappearance of a leucocytosis after an abscess 
is opened. 
The cause of this rapid increase of white blood 
corpuscles in strangulated Hernia, must be a 
matter of some speculation. Probably it is due 
to absorption of toxin, which is quickly produced in the damaged gut. It is a recognised 
fact that the Bacterium Coli commune , exist- 
¡AN 
inggreat numbers, can become rapidly pathogenic, 
once the gut in which they lie is seriously 
damaged. And it is not difficult to understand 
that in a condition like strangulated hernia, a very perfect factory for the production of toxin 
is established. The gut is damaged, and the 
Colon bacillus becomes pathogenic. Given such 
a toxaemia, plus a damaged tissue, the meaning 
of such a rapid leucocytosis becomes evident. 
The slow disappearance again of such a leucocytosis is no doubt due to the very slow recovery 
- 90 - 
of the damaged gut. The toxic products do not 
cease forming, directly the strangulation is 
relieved, and perhaps as long as the gut remains 
damaged, the colon bacillus retains its pathogenic properties. 
This disappearance of the existing leucocytosis 
is perhaps the best clinical guide we can have 
that a case is doing well. after the relief of 
the strangulation; and will give information 
as to the exact time when the gut has fully re- covered. 
Repeated records of casas can alone bring out 
the fullest and most reliable information concerning the subject of leucocytosis in strangulated hernia.

To the above ten cases of healing by primary union might 
be added those six records I made in non -suppurative 
appendicitis, all of which were stitched up at the operation and healed by first intention.(except case 25) 
In eleven out of the sixteen cases a mild degree of leucocytosis is produced by the operation. This leucocytosis varies in degree and it appears to have no relation 
whatever to the degree of severity of the operation. 
The highest, that of 24000 being due to McEwen's operation for knock knee, the next being two of 16000 due 
to operation for varicocele and excision of the appendix, whereas one case of amputation of the breast gave 
rise to no leucocytosis at all. 
In the five cases where the operation produced no leucocytosis, the anaesthetic either wholly or chiefly 
used was Ether. Chloroform seems to have a much greater tendency to increase the white corpuscles than ether. 
I noticed very much the same result in my cases of suppurative appendicitis. The leucocytosis on the day following operation was often greater than the count made 
just before the operation, when chloroform was the anaesthetic used. 
Loss of blood probably is an important factor ih the production of leucocytosis after aseptic wounds. Young 
patients are further -more _apt to give a leucocytosis 
- 98 - 
than old patients. 
In practically all those cases which showed a leucocytosis, we notice that it has disappeared about the second or third day after operation. The leucocytosis 
reaches its maximum in my records on the day following 
operation. 
I have very little doubt that a very well rnared leucocytosis will exist on the evening of the operation, as 
I have noticed this in several cases which I have examined 
though not recorded. 
In the great majority of cases the leucocytes reach 
a maximal normal (10000 per c.m.) on the teco'nd day, 
and failing this, on the third day. Case 7 is the only 
one that did not touch normal until the fourth day.

This case involved a very serious ole raticn with considerable h a.em.orrhage, which accounts for his high 
post -operative leucocytosis. This leucocytosis gradually disappeared and five days after the operation his 
count was practically a normal one. 
- 103 - It was on August 14th that suppuration was detected for 
the first time, although his wound had been dressed 
more than once. It will be observed that to the following day a new leucocytosis had appeared, due.no doubt 
to the retention of septic material between the flaps . As the drainage wasmade more perfects his leucocyte 
count began to fall, and on August 21st, although a large 
quantity of pus was pouring out of this wound, his 
blood count is a normal ene. 
Such a case convinces me, as did aise my records on the post -operative ccurse of suppurative appendicitis, 
that so long as pus is not pent up there is no general 
leucocytosis, as determined by examining the blood. 
There must of course be a very well marked local leucocytosis, to produce such large quantities of suppurat ion. It is probable therefore that the general leucowhich is cytosis is due to a positively chemiotactic toxin absorbed into the general circulation from a local focus 
of pent up pyogenic matter. Such a leucocytosis will 
disappear when free drainage is established, because 
such a toxin ceases to be absorbed.

There was a well marked leucocytosis after the operation, which rapidly dimininished. Suppuration was anticipated in this case, and on the fourth day after 
operation we get evidence of it in the temperature 
pulse and leucocyte count. When drainage becage free 
the leucocytosis disappeared. 
My cases of suppurating wounds are too few in number to 
enable me to make many definite statements with regard 
to the leucocytes. In pursuing my observations upon 
wound healing, I often thought I was peculiarly unfortunate in finding so many of the wounds heal by primary 
union. Not one of my cases of appendectomies suppurated, and none of the,cases of explorut ory 
laparotorw - which I made observations upon but have 
not recorded,- went wrong. 
with 
Yet these four cases above recorded, together my experience in the after treatment of suppurating appendicitis, lead. me to the opinion that if a wound suppurates, and there is imp3 rfect drainage leading to pent 
- 108 - 
up discharge, there will be a rise in the leucocyte curve 
about four days after the operation. As soon as free 
drainage is established, such a leucoc /tosis will rapidly disappear, even though the suppuration be considerable. This disappearance of leucocytosis during free 
drainage does not detract from the value of regular leucocyte counts in wound healing;- for it is not the free 
suppuration that the surgeon dreads so much as the pent 
up suppuration. This is specially emphasised in wounds 
involving the great serous membranes of the body. 
It may be annoying to the careful surgeon to find his technique imperfect when operating on wounds that involve no 
internal cavity., but it is not fraught with the sane danger and prolific with the same anxiety asimperfect technique when such cavities are involved. 
it is in our laparotomies, our trephinings, and arthrectomies that a regular leucocyte record would probably prove of the greatest value in wound 
healing; though in large wounds, such as amputation of 
the breast, it might be of value also. We can all remember cases of suppuration in wounds in which t he temperature, pulse and local symptoms signally failed to give 
the slightest evidence of it. Early recognition cf such 
a suppuration is of the greatest value, and it is as a worthy adjunct to the evidences already in use that

only to be explained by the onset of the pneumonia,

This case gives little or no post operative leucocytosis 
and the probable explanation is that the severe form of 
pneumonia was sufficient to paralyse his reactionary 
qualities, and prevent not only the usual post operative 
leucocytosis, but also the leucocytosis expected in septic pneumonia. The low count then probably is to be interpreted as pointing to a grave prognosis.

There are quantitative estimations of leucocytes in eight 
cases of simple fracture, qualititative estimations in five 
All were cases of fracture of the femur. In six out of 
the eight there was a definite leucocytosis within a 
few hours of the accident. In case 3 there was a fairly well marked bronchitis present, so that his count 
cannot clearly be interpreted. The differential counts 
bring out the fact that it is the so- called poly morphoneuclear neutrophiles that are increased. 
In two cases myelocytes were present. 
The count in fractures is very much that of a wound 
showing primary union, only the tissue involved is 
an 
bone instead of soft part, and any effect of anaesthetic 
is absent. It will be observed that in five out of the 
six cases showing leucocytosis, that the count had fallen to normal on the day following the fracture, so 
that the leucocytosis is a very temporary one. 
In seven out of the eight casas of simple fracture, 
the patient is practically a child. Corresponding observations upon adults would be of interest. 
The cause of the usual leucocytosis after fracture is 
probably loss of blood, associated with injury to tissue, both of which call upon the leucocytes to deal 
with the damage done. Local stimulation of bone marrow 
as a cause is probably of less importance.

From four cases it is impossible to draw many definite 
conclusion, about the leucocyte counts in Erysipelas, 
Nevertheless, seeing that my cases were all extensive 
ones, threeof them giving considerable anxiety as to 
the life of the patient, it was not a trifle surprising 
to realise the results I obtained. 
The records upon Erysipelas are not numerous, but those 
obtained by Von Limbeck, Reider, Reinert, Halla and 
others differ very markedly from my own. 
I should say there is absolutely no parallel between the 
temperature and the leucocyte count. There was in my 
cases no relation between the leucocytosis and the 
spread of the rash. 
In the first few days of all my cases there was no leucocytosis present; towards the termination of the disease, a mild leucocytosis appeared, which was of short 
duration. 
The leucocytosis is due to an increase in the poly - morphonouclear cells.

to the cranial cavity. 
In this case also, in which Dr. Macdonald identified 
the organism of 8t il] there is a very definite leucocytosis. It varies somewhat from day to day, due to 
causes one cannot easily determine. The increase in 
white cells was entirely of the poly- morpho- neuclear 
character. 
he last leucocyte count is specially high, and this was 
probably due to the terminal injection Of the sphenoidal 
and ethmoidal air cells, which from the character of 
the bone surrounding was of a very recent origin.

and mentally. 
This condition supervened upon an attack of pneumonia, 
and would have been of much greater interest had the 
bacteriology been more exact. There were definite diplo 
cocci in the cerebro- spinal fluid obtained by lumbar 
puncture, which in shape resembled pneumo -cocci. But as some accident happened to the exploring syringe at the 
time of withdrawl of the fluid,reliable cultures could 
not be made. 
The differential count made was practically that of a healthy child, one nucleated red being found whilst 
counting 500 white cells. 
The leucccytosis is a moderate one that gradually disap

This boy for weeks was a perfect puzzle. He was admitted for Otitis Media, was operated upon on September 18 
beyond a small abscessunder the scalp,no pus was found. 
It is probable that this small abscess accounted for 
his mild initial leucocytosis, as it disappeared a few 
days after the operation. On October 1st he had a rigor; 
then followed a few days in which he exhibited a mild 
but irregular degree of leucocytosis. 
He was sent to a convalescent home on October 9th. I felt that there must be some cause to account for the 
leucocytosis, and I was surprised to find him discharged. He returned however on October 18th much 
worse, with a high temperature and mild leucocytosis. 
His skull was trephined, but thing could be found. 
The boy at times spoke of a slight headache, but apart 
from this, he had no symptoms whatever. He was seen by 
several surgeons and one or two physicians. At last 
(this being about the end of October) Dr. Lewis discovered that the boy had Koenig's sign, and suggested 
the advisability of having a lumbar puncture made. 
This was done, and revealed several important- facts. 
Firstly it showed that there was very marked intra 
spinal peessure, as when the needle entered the spinal 
canal, the piston of the exploring syringe was shot 
back by the pressure from within, and when the syringe 
- 131 - 
was detached from. the needle insitu, the cerebro- spinal 
fluid was ejected as a spurt from the needle. 
Secondly the cerebro- spinal fluid was turbid, and third 
ly on cultivation it showed a rich growth of staphylococcus PY ogenes aureus. 
I was unable to follow the case after November 2nd, but 
it was drained in the lumbar region, so as to allow slow 
leakage from an incision in this region. 
The boy died on November 13th. 
Post Mortem revealed a suppurative meningitis. It is 
very difficult indeed to interpret the leucocyte count 
in this case. The low degree and marked fitfulness of 
the leucocytosis points to some low infective condition, 
that ebbs and flows in its severity. In the light of his 
lumbar puncture, one is compelled to think that he had 
suffered from a meningitis probably caused by his otitis 
media, and which was of a very sub -acute nature. The 
patient, beyond complaining of slight headache, showed 
practically nothing to suggest such a pathological condition; his rigor, irregular temperature and leucocytosis pointed to some obscure condition, but there were no 
characteristic symptoms of meningitis till November 1st. 
After his spinal drainage, his symptoms became more aggravated, and he gradually sank. 
- 132 - Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, and streptococcus 
pyogenes were found by the pathologist in his 
cerebro- spinal fluid after death. 
C O N C L U S I O N S. 
1. Weningitis due to the diplococcus of still generally produces a well marked leucocytosis, which has 
a tendency to fluctuate in degree from day to day. 
2. In one of my cases there was lymphocytosis present. 
In the other two it was the poly neuclear cell 
that showed the increase. 
3. In case 4, which was in all probability a pneumococcic meningitis, there was a mild leucocytosis 
in the early stage of the disease which disappeared early in the convalescence. The increase 
of white cells in this case was due to the poly - neuclear cells. 
4. Myelocytes were found in one of my cases of Still's 
meningitis, and also in case 5, due to Staphyloccoci and 5trepLz)cec,ci. 
in csse, 5 
5 The leucocytosis was very mild and fitful, normal 
counts being recorded on several days during the 
disease. 
- 133 - 6. Estimation of leucocytes might be of value in dis 
tinguishing meningitis from such diseases as hysteria, tetany, typhoid, diabetic coma, coma due to 
alcohol or cerebral tumour, to lead poisoning, all 
of which give no leucocytosis. 
Obviously it could not aid one in a differential 
diagnosis from localised suppurations of the brain.

This is a typical case of pyaemia, and manifests a very 
well marked leucocytosis from the beginning to the end. 
The record is necessarily a long and tedious one, at times 
running for days at a steady rate of leucecytic increase 
at others exhibiting a series of rises and falls which it 
is not easy to interpret aright. Probably the leucocyte 
curve rises mom or less parallel to the amount of or 
virulence of toxic products generated locally, or already circulating in the blood. 
The leucocytosis was entirely due to an increase in the 
poly niuclear cells.

Another typical case of Py4emia following middle ear 
disease. He was admitted with a large mastoid abscess . which accounted no doubt for the mild leucocytosis present. I was astonished to ,find such a low degree of leucocytosis from so large an abscess. The patient was 
however severely ill, and seemed to have been much exhausted by his middle ear mischief before his pygemia 
set in. His count fell somewhat after his first operation, but soon rose again until it reached 21000 when 
the second operation was done. After this point we have

from his occipital abscess a few minutes after death, 
and again obtained a pure growth of staphylococcus pyogenes aureus. The large fall in his leucocytosis on 
August 23rd was due to the evacuation of such a large 
abscess. It soon began to rise again steadily until 
- 141 - 
it reached a maximum on August 28th. About this date he 
developed symptoms of pericarditis. We then noticed that 
his leucocyte curve began to fall, and this was probably due to the gradual and overwhelming dose of toxin 
generated by the severe pericarditis and pleurisy.

This case illustrates how low the leucocyte count may 
be in a case of severe pyaemia. This patient must have 
been suffering from general blood poisoning for some 
time before admission. It looks as if he had been so far spent by his otitis media, that when this grave 
complication of pyaemia set in, that his reactionary 
powers had become so exhausted that the leucocytosis 
had begun to wane, as we noticed in the terminal stage 
of case 3.

Post Mop tem examination revealed sub deltoid abscess, 
emp *8m4 -, pus in knee joint, no visceral abscesses, 
generative organs healthy. General anaemia in all the 
organs, slight pneumonia. 
For quite a considerable time after admission this case 
remained a mystery. Many suggestions as to diagnosis 
were given, but none with any degree of certainty. 
My leucocyte counts threw no light whatever upon the 
case, indeed I regarded them as distinctly weakening 
the possibility that our patient was suffering from 
pyaemia. The fallacy of this I learned later. 
A Widal gave a negative result. 
It will be evident that during the month of September 
there was no leucocytosis present whatever, even though 
an abscess developed over her sacrum. 
It was by finding strepto -cocci in the pus of this ab- 
- 146 - 
scess that I was led to take cultivations from the 
patient's blood. The nature of the case then became 
clear. We had to deal with a low form of strepto -coccic pyaemia. Anti- strepto- coccic serum was then inject 
ed hypodermically. 
Whether it was due to these injections or to pure coincidence I do.not know, but a day or two after the 
third injection, the patient showed a definite leucocytosis for the first time. This leucocytosis was maintained and increased until the end of my observations, 
and it can be observed as in the other case of pyaemia 
that the same fluctuation, the same ebb and flow is 
present in the leucocye curve. The highest count recorded is that of October 31st, and this was due to a large sub - deltoid and axillary abscess which had existed 
some time before it was opened on November 4th. 
The next highest count, that of October 28th, was due 
to a gluteal abscess, which was opened on the following 
day. 
This patient pres anted a clinical picture of the most 
intrinsic interest. At the outset of her hospital 
career she lay on her bed complaining of nothing but 
weakness. She was emaciated, feverish and fretful. Her 
pulse was rapid, her tongue dry and raw, and her skin 
_Iry, rough and covered by fine scales. 
- 147 - 
She was alert and suspicious of all who came near her. 
Every method of examination was exhausted except the 
one which proved of so much value. I am surprised now 
that we did not examine her blood for bacteria earlier 
in her disease. My low leucocyte count was largely responsible for the delay. I took it for granted that 
a person who had battled so long as this case, with some 
foe of undoubted severity, would have given a definite 
leucocytosis, had it been of a pyaemic nature. We 
only obtained an exact history from her ire dical attendant several weeks after her admission to hospital. 
I t is a matter of intense interest to realise the complete absence of leucocytosis in the early weeks of 
her disease. It might be that. she had become too exhausted by her mammary abscess to offer much reaction 
to the invasion of a strepto -coccus, or it might be that 
she had become gradually used to an increasing dove 
of strepto -coccic toxin without manifesting any degree 
of leuc;,cytic response. 
Any one who was not familiar with the case would proba -- 
ly ascribe it to the very small n oftoxin produced, or 
to its extremely low virulence, yet the appearance of 
the patient pointed to a severe toxaemia. Is it possible that the preliminary normal leucocyte counts are 
allied in any way to that preliminary leucopenic con- 
- 148 - 
dition met with by Jacob and Goldsneider in their experiments on invective processes in animals? Soon after her third dose of anti- strepto- coccic serum, and 
about ten days after her first abscess appeared, a 
definite leucocytosis began. Whether the anti- strepto -- coccic serum so improved her reactionary qualities or 
whether there was an increased production of toxin to 
account for this leucocytosis I do not know. 
A very interesting fact is revealed by the differential 
count made on October 29th, for although the quantitative count is a normal one, it will be seen that the poly 
neuclear cells are relatively much. increased in number. 
It would be a work of great interest to make careful 
differential counts of these normal quantitative estimations of leucocytes in Pyaemia, to ascertain whether my experience in this case is usual or not. If it 
is usual, it might be a point of considerable value 
from the diagnostic point, of view. 
Throughout, this case was purely of a strepto- ccccic 
nature, and this fact, associated with its slow chronic 
course, renders it of peculiar interest.

Post Mortem examination revealed a localised empyema. 
in left pleura, unresolved pneumonia at right base, 
hydropericardium, profound anaemia. 
I venture to think that such an usual condition as this, 
is not unworthy of mention,because of its chronic course 
and comparative rarity. Pneumococci were obtained from 
the blood in large numbers on four different occasions, 
twice by Dr. Macdonald and twice by myself. The child 
was extremely anaemic. The anti- pneumococcic serum appeared to hasten her end rather than delay it. Her temperature became higher, her exhaustion more marked, and 
her leucocytosis became less than at any time during my 
observations. The leucocyte curve illustrates the same 
irregularity that we have observed in pyaemia. The differential count is a remarkable one, in that the variety 
of white corpuscle increased is the small lymphocyte. 
Lymphoctosis has been recorded in one case of pneumonia 
by Cabet, and it is not a little interesting to find 
- 151 - such a distinct lymphocytosis in this well marked. case 
of pneumococcic septicaemia. 
Six myelocytes and four nucleated red corpuscles were 
observed whilst counting 500 white corpuscles.

1. In Pyaemia and Septicaemia there is generally a 
well marked leucocytosis. 
2. The leucocytosis ebbs and flows according to a variety of conditions that our present knowledge 
cannot interpret with certainty. 
3. The increase of white corpuscles is generally 
due to a poly nquclear leucocytosis, thor.i01 in my 
case of pneumococcic septicaemia it was chiefly 
a lymphocytosis. 
4. There may be an entire absence of leucocytosis, 
as in the early stage of my case of streptococcic 
pyaernia . 5. The leucocytosis generally falls to a lower level 
within the last few days of life.

with considerable accumulation of pus at the base of 
the brain and between the hemispheres. 
-- 153 - 
Cerebral mischief was not suspected until May 24th. In 
spite of the operation on T;Tay 22nd, at which the antrum 
was opened and pus evacuated, the leucocyte curve keeps 
steadily advancing. It might be thought that the anaes 
thetic, which on both occasions was chloroform, is sufficient to account for this rise after each operation, 
but this cannot be the only cause, inasmuch as the leucocytosis is maintained and increased from day to day. 
It is I think quite a legitimate conclusion to draw 
that given a rising leucocyte curve after free drainage 
of the antrum in Otitis media, that there must be some 
complication, such as extra durai abscess, meningitis, 
or suppurative thrombosis. 
The last count, taken a few hours before death, is lower than the preceding one, and I regard it as another 
example of the decreasing vitality of approaching death,

Suppurative otitis media gives rise to well marked 
leucocytosis. 
All my cases were complicated with antral mischief, and 
most of them with cerebral infection. 
It is quite likely that leucocye counts might be of 
value in excluding complications in suppurative otitis 
media. If after perforating the tympanum, establishing free drainage, and regulareyringi g there still 
exists a leucocytosis, complications might be suspected. 
Then if after the antrum,is trephined, and drained, a 
rising leucocytosis is still observed, it is strong evidence in favor of cerebral mischief of some kind, as is 
seen in Case 1.

-- 156 - The degree of leucocytosis is of little value in estimating the extent of suppuration present, nor can it 
in any way be an indicationas to whether cerebral complications are present or not, unless the otitis medic 
or antral mischief has been dealt with by operation. 
It is probable that very grave cases with virulent 
infections will give normal er sub- normal counts, as 
is seen in pneumonia, diptheria or peritonitis, and 
this possibility must not be forgotten. 
In favorable cases, such as case 3, we obtain a rapid 
disappearance of the leucocytosis after free drainage 
is established.

This case of greater interest, and my record is of much 
more value. On the second day of my observations I gave it as my opinion that suppuration had been established, and I am still of the same opinion. The surgeon 
was in great doubt as to whether he ought to cut down 
on the massornot, but eventually decided not to, largely because of the patient's aversion to being operated 
upon. He was put upon frequent fomentations, and his 
subsequent progress is of great interest. The leucocyte curve upon October 9th, on which day a differential count brought out the marked increase in poly nuclear finely granular oxyphiles, and the unusual increase in Eosinophiles. From this day the leucocyte 
numeral fell slowly and steadily from day to day, so much so that it took ten days to fall from 15000 to 
11000. The temperature behaved very much like the blood 
curve. I feel as satisfied now as I did at the time of 
my second count1that this was a suppurative lymphadenitie, and I regard it an as example of a small quantity 
of pus hemmed in, destroyed, and finally absorbed bÿ 
local reactionary measured. It cannot accurately 
- 159 - 
be defined at what stage the process of inflammation 
may stop short of suppuration and recover itself. It is 
not a generally accepted idea that even quantities of 
pyogenic pus can be absorbed and destroyed h r nature 
under expectant measures. The surgeon is apt to imagine 
that if suppuration is once established, it must come to 
a head sol where and evacuate itself. My work upon 
gynecological cases points to a greater frequency of 
nature's cures than hitherto I thought possible. Of 
course I do not advocate for one moment the use of expectant measures in suppurative conditions. The risk 
of leaving them to nature is considerably greater than 
proper surgical measures for their removal. Indeed my 
blood record seems to strengthen the position of the 
surgeon, for I feel sure, had an incision been made in 
this man's tender lump, pus would probably have been 
evacuated, and his blood count and local condition would 
have recovered more rapidly: 
The blood count did not reach normal until seventeen 
days after the maximum count.

I have introduced this case here merely to compare it 
with the foregoing. It was regarded as a suppurative 
lymphadenitis, although it is quite possible that it was 
a case of suppurative appendipitis. The count is a high 
ones and a rising one. At the operation the pus was 
missed, the leucocytosis is still maintained until the 
abscess was accidentally opened. Then the decrease in 
the leucocyte numeral commences. It is of interest to 
compare the effect of treatment upon the leucocyte 
curve of this case, with the preceding one. In case 2, 
from expectant treatment, we observe a fall from 15000 
to 11000 in ten days, whereas in case 3, from evacuation 
methods, we notice a fall from 29000 to 11000 in seven 
days. Many better examples could be obtained from my 
suppurative records to illustrate the advantage of free 
drainage in expectant methods in abscess formations.

Post Morte-rn revealed a large round celled sarcoma of 
bronchial glands and right lung. 
The first count, which is the highest, was taken on the 
day of admission. The subsequent record gives a remark 
8b ly steady rate of leucocytosis. The diagnosis just 
made was bronchiectasis, but it would be well nigh impossible to obtain such a leucocyte record in bronchiec 
tasis. It would fluctuate according to the degree of 
retention of the purulent secretion. The next diagnosismmde was fibroid phthisis, but here again my leucocyte 
numeral would not fit in. In phthisis, unless cavita- 
- 170 - tion exists, the blood count is normal, and if a cavi ty 
be present, the leucocytosis is always a fluctuating one 
Empyema was excluded by introducing an exploring needle 
into the chest, with a negative result. New. growth was 
then suspected, and the steady position of the leucocyte 
curve which is a striking feature in this case, was not 
opposed to that view. The patient died, and a large sar 
coma was revealed in the root of his right lung.

first case there was a mild lyprnocytosis present. 
C O N C L U S I O N S. 
Out of my nine cases of Sarcoma, three gave a definite 
leucocytosis, two out of the three were cases of visceral sarcoma, and the third an advanced lymphosarcoma. 
My four cases of ostea sarcoma showed no leucocytosis 
whatever, one of which was very advanced, and of a very 
malignant type. A mild lyrnphocytosis existed in one of 
the fases. 
The case of sarcoma of the ovary with secondary deposits 
gave normal quantitative counts. The slight increase 
of white corpuscles seen in my case of malignant angioma was in all probability entirely accounted for by the 
septic condition of the ulceration. 
These results are obviously very different to those obtained by Harem, . Alexander, LiMbeck and others. Zn the 
majority of their cases a very well marked leucocytosis 
was found, and they regarded this as sufficiently con - stand to be of considerable assistance in diagnosis. 
I regret that my experience is so much different to 
theirs, because from the diagnostic point of view my 
- 174 - results are very unsatisfactory. A leucocytosis in three 
out of nine cases is much too inconstant to speak with 
any decision about the matter. 
Some of my cases, which gave normal leucocyte counts, 
were certainly not rapidly growing1nor advanced, but 
several of them again were very advanced and very rapid 
in growth. 
Visceral cases, and glanular sarcoma seem to ne to give 
A rise to increase of leucocytes more constantly than osteo 
sarcoma. 
There is not however anything like the same constancy 
of leucocyte proliferation as we have seen in suppuration. 
Two of my cases gave a lymphocytosis rather than a poly 
n4uclear° leucocytosis. 
In specially selected cases, given a leucocytosis it 
might be of value in pointing to a sarcoma, but I cannot 
help feeling that the absence of leucocytosis does not 
in the least exclude sarcoma. 
I shall work at this subject with considerable interet 
in future, in order to multiply my records and convince 
myself of the true relation of leucocytosis to this disease.

I/ 
In twenty nine cases of carcinoma, only nine showed any 
degree of leucocytosis. My highest count was 19000, 
obtained in a case of cancer of the rectum, my next high 
est were three cases of carcinoma of rectum, breast and 
liver, giving 14,000. The remaining five were between 
11000 and 13000. 
Out of eight cases of rectal carcinoma, three showed a definite leucocytosis. They were all advanced cases in 
which ulceration was present, and I am not at all sure whether ulceration in this locality where bacterium coli 
are so plentiful, is not sufficient in itself to account 
for the leucocytosis present. 
In ragged ulceration with sepsis it is very difficult 
to know how much of the leucocytosis is due to pyogenic 
matter, and how much to the carcinoma. The differential 
count shows that the increase is in Poly nuclear cells 
a fact which is not against this septic explanation of 
leucocytosis in the alimentary canal. 
- 184 - Carcinoma in solid viscera and glands like the mamma 
present no such complication, and any leucocytosis present must be ascribed to the growth. It is rather a 
significant fact that s even out of the nine. cases showing leucocytosis were associated either primarily or secondarily with the alimentary canal. The eighth was 
seen in an ulcerating encephaloid of the breast, the 
ninth in a one year old scirrhus. Case 5, in which there 
was extensive ulceration of the stomach, gave no leucocytosis. Ulcers of the stomach, even malignant ones, 
are not so prone to become septic as intestinal ulcers 
owing to the antiseptic qualities of the gastric juice. 
After reading the literature on the subject of leucocytosis in carcinoma, I fear that I cannot accept all the 
conclusions that have been laid down concerning this 
subject. My observations have entirely failed to prove 
that the presence or absence of leucocytosis is of much 
value in the diagnosis of carcinoma. And whenever such 
uncertainty exists, it is quite impossible to rely on 
the leucocyte count for assistance in the diagnosis of 
such a disease. Leucocytosis may occur, especially in 
advanced carcinoma, associated with ulcerations, but even 
in advanced stages it may be entirely absent. 
Leucocytosis is less rarely seen in cancer than in sarcoma.

If practitioners waited until a general leucocytosis 
was present before diagnosing carcinoma, it is surely 
obvious that the operative treatment for such cases 
would be less than useless.

This case was of interest. He had been acutely ill for 
two days, brought on by a severe chill. He had suffered 
from a cough for several weeks. The question arising in 
the physician's mind was - is this pneumonia? - or is it 
bronchitis in a phthisical patient? Consolidated lung 
giving bronchial breathing was an important feature .in this case. 
The leucocyte count is very low for such an apparently 
acute attack of pneumonia, if pneumonia it was, and the 
leucocytosis present on the first two days, points I think 
- 187 - 
to bronchitis rather than to pneumonia. On a stimulat 
ing expectorant mixture the bronchitis cleared up in a few days, and a well marked phthisis was evident.

There can be no doubt that this was infected at the 
operation; there was a definite leucocytosis on the 
day following operation, which was more or less maintained as long as my observations lasted. The temperature and general progress of the patient bore this out 
to the full. It is probable that a daily estimation of 
the leucocytes would be an irnFortar_t guide as to whether tuberculous abscesses, which had been opened, scraped

This case was thought to be one of Tuberculous abscess. 
I took a leucocyte count, and found a very great increase. It informed me that this abscess was not purely a tuberculous condition, and that septic organisms 
must be present. This fact I proved by making cultures 
from the pus. 
192 - Another interesting feature is brought out by the behaviour after operation. I informed the surgeon previous to the operation that it must be an abscess of 
mixed infect ion. He t reated i t as pure tuberculous 
lesion - opening, scraping, and closing it up. The 
result was of course,that it suppurated freely. A leucocyte count in such abscesses might be of value in 
one of ascertaining whether we are dealing withApure bacillary 
nature or of mixed infection. 
No cause for this abscess could be detected, and it 
is just possible that it was not even a primarily 
tuberculous one.

This case was an old one with undoubted waxy degeneration in liver and kidneys. He was emaciated and hectic. His leucocytosis is accounted for by the copious 
septic discharge. The wound suppurated after the opera 
tion. For at least a month subsequent to the operation 
there was a moderate degree of leucocytosis. On October 4th, the wounds having all healed, we find that his 
count is a normal one. He became fatter and stronger 
very rapidly. This case proves pretty conclusively 
that getting rid of the sepsis gets rid of the leucocytosis, even though waxy disease be still present.

Before operation there was no leucocytosis. After the

reaches a maximum on July 19th. From this day it steadily fell until it reached 11000 on the last day in 
July. On August 1st pus was seen in the discharge for 
the first time. On August 7th the leucocytes have in- 
- 196 - 
creased enormously. It was very unfortunate that a post 
mortem was refused. The post operative leucocytosis is 
no doubt due to an intense local reaction produced by 
Stripping away the hydatid membrane and possibly to a 
local peritonitis set up around the drainage tube. The 
high leucocytosis on August 7th is either due to the sep 
tic processes within the Yiydatid cavity or to a peritoni 
tis from some perforation or another.

Post Mortem confirmed the diagnosis. 
This case was suggestive of suppurating hydatid cyst. 
The temperature, pulse, leucocyte count and local conditions all pointed to it. It is of very great importance to the surgeon ' o know whether he is dealing with 
a pure hydatid or a septic hydatid. If the latter, his 
endeavor to shut off the general peritoneum would be more 
assiduous, as the danger of peritonitis is so much greater. Estimation of the leucocytes in such cases would 
probably be of value in determining whether suppuration 
exists or not.

Widal's reaction can give no information in the first 
few days of such an illness, and even after the fifth 
day of illness, it is quite impossible for the general 
practitioner to apply such a test. It is however within the easy reach of all to estimate the number of leucocytes per cubic millimetre. If this were done many 
of those obscure cases of early pneumonia giving no phy 
sical signs - such as central pneumonia, and which so closely simulate enteric fever, would become clear.

This is without doubt an exceptional case. The attack 
was a severe one, yet not severe enough to ever give 
anxiety as to prognosis. I followed the case with no 
little excitement. It was impossible to regard it as 
the count of a mild case; and to give a satisfactory 
- 206 - 
interpretation of my results is no easy matter. This 
patient was a strong robust man, and the question aris 
es - is it possible that a physical constitution can 
be so strong, sosthenic that it can afford to treat 
even a large dose cf pneumonic toxin with contempt? 
Or is it likely that this is an example of a prolonged 
preliminary leucopenia prior to the ensuing leucocytosis, as is seen in the experimental infections in animals? 
The simplest explanation of course would be that it 
was in reality a mild case, but its clinical appearance was entirely opposed to that view. It might be 
that some human mechanisms are possessed of distinct 
idiosyncracies in reference to this vital function of 
leucocytic reaction to bacterial infection. Children 
certainly react more readily than adults; and it is 
not unlikely that some adult natures retain that peculiar sensitive function of reaction,more readily than 
others. It is rather a remarkable fact that even while 
there is no leucocytosis on October 28th and 29th, the 
ratio of poly nuclear finely granular oxyphiles is increased, and this increase steadily becoming more marked 
from day to day, reaches its maximum on October 30th, 
the same day as the maximum quantitative count. Eosinophiles were absent from the films taken on October 28 
and 29, and reappeared towards the crisis.

At this stage the boy was allowed to get up, though 
still pale. 
This case is an excellent example of a slowly resolving 
pneumonia, lasting nearly three months. It was a double 
pneumonia, and his reaction is very vigorous. It furnishes the highest degree of leucocytosis which I obtained during my observations. On the day of his crisis 
his leucocytosis was 73,000, and from this maximum it 
fell steadily for three weeks until it reached 18000. 
Then we get an exacerbation which is more or less main - the count 
tamed for several weeks, and then falls very slowly until well nigh normal, at which point the boy was sent to 
- 210 - a convalescent home. 
Such a leucocyte record is not found without a reason, 
and it is all the more striking because of the approximately normal condition of the temperature, pulse and 
respirations. The boy never complained,but it was not 
difficult to see that he did not improve as he ought 
to have done. The question of Empyerna arose on sever 
al occasions, a needle was introduced more than once, 
but nothing was revealed; so that one is driven to look 
upon this as a case of slow resolution, and not as some 
suppu rative condit ion. 
It is thus a significant fact that after all the cardinal symptoms of pneumonia have disappeared, after the 
temperature, pulse and respiration have become normal, 
that the leucccye record should remain a high one. 
Such a fact would suggest that a careful estimation of 
the leucocytes is one of the best guides as to whether 
a case of convalescing pneumonia is progressing favorably or not. When the leucocyte curve has fallen, to 
normal, and remains so for sonne days, the case may be 
regarded as sufficiently recovered to be out of danger.

- 213 - and his temperature seem to bear this out. The leucocytes did not fall after his crisis to any e xtent, so 
that it is impossible at which point the empyema began 
to form. It is probable that there was retarded resolution, which was gradually followed by the empyema. The 
leucocytosis slowly disappeared after the empyema was 
opened. Such a case as this suggests the advisability 
of not hesitating to introduce the exploring needle when 
ever the leucocyte curve points to some complication. 
If this was done many of the unfortunate deaths following 
an attack of pneumonia would be prevented. 
It is also an example of the value that regular leucocyte estimation can be in pneumonia. The knowledge that 
a definite leucocytosis still exists at some time after 
the crisis would induce the medical attendant to examine 
his patient carefully for retarded resolution or suppuration, before allowing hirn to get up or be discharged. 
A student does not require to work in the post mortem 
room long Wore he meets with cases of undiagnosed empyema following pneumonia. An examination of the leucocytes from time to time during convalesence would prevent the pathologist from revealing a large number of 
these unfortunate conditions. What is the little extra 
trouble of leucocyte estimation, compared to the genuine 
satisfaction of knowing how one's patient really is pro- 
- 214 - 
I do not of course forget the value of such clinical 
aids as the temperature and the pulse, but we know hour 
occasionally they mislead us, and I am convinced that 
the leucocyte numeral is more sensitive than either.

which it slowly fell to normal No evidence of suppura

- 217 - day the leucocytosis had diminished by seven thousand, 
and on the following day againfhad entirely disappeared 
The patient was acutely ill, and could not possibly have 
had a true crisis. He died on the morning of August 3. 
Such a falling leucocyte curve in the early days of a 
severe pneumonia, can only have one true explanation,- 
namely-that the vital reactionary power of the patient 
is being rapidly paralysed by the overwhelming dose of 
pneumonic or other toxin. The differential counts in 
this case were of great interest. The film taken on 
July 31st was stained by eosine and methyline blue, and 
I experienced no difficulty whatever in seeing that the 
leucocytosis was almost entirely a poly -nuclear one of 
the fim ly granular variety. There were four myelocytes 
present amongst the 500 leucocytes counted. 
The film taken on August 2nd was very different. It was 
stained by Ehrlich's so called tri -acid mixture. The 
granules as usual took up the stain with great brilliance, so much so that I had great difficulty at times 
in making up my mind whether the more faintly stained 
nucleus was single or multiple. The myelocytes which 
have been credited to each differential count, were undoubted ones, but it is quite possible, despite the fact 
that a 1500 magnification power was used, that a much higher myelocytosis existed. In all the differential counts 
- 217 - 
I made in these cases of fatal pneumonia, except the 
one taken on July 31st, the films were stained with 
Ehrlich's mixture, and in all I had the same difficulty. 
The nuclei of the poly nuclear cells appeared to be larg 
er than normal,mnre faintly stained , and tending to adhere together in one part of the bodyof the cell. The 
idea suggested was a kind of transitional cell between 
the poly nuclear finely granular oxyphile, and the uninuclear finely granular myelocyte. 
A0 rar as I know there are no existing records of dif - ferential counts in these fatal cases of pneumonia, which 
show no leucocytosis. I shall endeavor to pursue my 
investigations on this :a tter to greater length, and in 
doing soiI feel sure that the eosine and m thlene blue 
stain will give more definite results.

C ON CLU SI ON S. 
I, Pneumonia gives rise to a very definite leucocytosis of 
a poly nuclear variety. 
2. The leucocytosis probably begins to appear on the first 
day of illness. 
Z. If the patient is vigorous, and the dose of toxin not 
overwhelming, the leucocytosis increases steadily day by 
day, reaching its maximum about the day of the crisis. 
4 If the pneumonia is mild, the leucocyte curve may anticipate the crises, and fall to normal a day or two before the crisis. 
'5 If the attack is a severe one, with marked leucocytosis 
the leucocytosis is mintained for several days after 
the crisis, and falls to normal gradually. 
6. A mild attack of pneumonia gives rise to a mild degree 
of leucocytosis. A severe attack, with vigorous reaction, gives rise to a high degree of leucocytosis; a severe attack with poor reaction gives little or no leucocytosis. 
In one case, No. 5, there was no leucocytosis until the 
6th day of disease, although the case was a severe one, 
in a strong robust man; -such an exceptional case is 
as well kept in mind when the question of prognosis is 
being considered. 
7. Five of irk sixteen cases proved fatal. In four of these 
-221 - 
I was only able to make one observation, because of the 
patient's death, but they all gave either normal or subnormal leucocyte counts. In the fifth I was able to 
make three daily observations. The first day gave a 
leucocytosis of 21000, the second to 14,000, the third 
to 6000. He died the following day. 
So that a falling count in a severe case of pneumonia 
as well as a normal or sub-normal count taken some days 
after the commencement of the attack, must be regarded 
as a very grave indication. 
Of course it must not be assumed that every case of pneu 
monia giving a definite leucocytosis will recover - many 
of the highest degrees of leucocytosis are found in 
fatal cases, simply because there is severity of disease associated with vigorous reaction, and the battle 
ends in the favor of the former. The point is that in 
those cases of severe pneumonia, giving normal, subnormal, or even falling leucocyte counts before the 
crisis, the prognosis is bad. It is nevertheless rather remarkable that none of my cases showing well 
marked leucocytosis proved fatal. 
The differential counts in three of my cases of fatal 
pneumonia, prove that although the quantitative pount 
is a normal one, there is a well marked increase in 
the poly -nuclear cells. Myelocytes were present in all 
- 222 - my cases. I think it quite possible that I have underestimated the exact degree of myelocytosis, and I submit 
my results in this matter with a certain degree of reser 
vation. 
S. In retarded resolution the leucocytosis is maintained 
for at indefinite time after the crisis - it may be for 
weeks or even months. 
Such a condition of things might call for a searching 
examination to exclude suppuration. The temperature in a case of pure resolution, does not appear to be so much 
elevated as in suppurative complications, but the exploring needle should be used freely if there is any 
doubt. The leucocytosis in retarded resolution is 
definite, irregular in degree, and tends to disappear 
gradually. 
Suppuration following pneumonia is similarly indicated 
by a rising leucocytosis after the count has fallen to 
normal, or it resembles that of retarded resolution in 
being a continuation,on a lower scale,of the primary 
pneumonic leucocytosis. Suppuration is probably assodiated with more elevation of temperature than retarded resolution. An exploring needle is however our best 
means of distinction. 
10. It is quite easy to realise that under certain circumstances an examination of the leucocytes might be of 
- 223 - considerable value in the differential diagnosis of Pneu 
monia. Such conditions as typhoid, malaria, influenza 
are very liable to be confused with it before physical 
signs appear in its early stages, and all of these give 
rise to no leucocytosis. Measles and pure tuberculo 
sis again can be excluded by the prossnce of leucocytosis. 
11. Of course leucocyte estimation must Only be employed 
in conjunction with the other clinical methods of diagnosis.already at our disposal. In central pneumonia, 
especially where there is an entire absence of physical 
signs, we find it of great value.

A definite leucocytosis, which is increasing. The leucocytosis, though falling considerably after the evacuation of the pus, is still quite evident two weeks after 
the operation. This is after all nor surprising; the 
pleural cavity does not drain freely after an empyema 
is opened, then there is probably some special susceptibility to general leucocytosis, when the lung is the 
seat of the inflammatory trouble. We see it in a retarded resolution in pneumonia, and in none of my empydi rectly 
erras has the leucocytosis disappeared after evacuation. 
A well marked local leucocytosis will exist for sonne 
- 225 - time after an abscess is opened, and when the lung is involved in that abscess, it is possible that this local 
leucocytosis is sufficient to account for a general leucocytosis 
The bad drainage however is without doubt an important 
factor in that persistent leucocytosis.

Sent to the Jaffray Hospital discharging

A very high degree of leucocytosis is seen in this case 
which had fallen almost to normal three days after operation. This case appeared to drain very satisfactorily, 
there was nevertheless a very faint excess of leucocytes 
three weeks after the operation. The temperature recovers its normal standard in advance of the leucocyte 
curve, he pulse and the respirations.

No more counts taken. 
This case is a direct example of the value of a leucocyte 
record. Had an occasional count been made, of this 
child's leucocytes after her attack of pneumonia, it 
would probably have led to a more careful examination 
of the chest and then to exploratory puncture earlier 
than it did. When I discovered this leucocytosis present, I could only say that there must be a complication, 
and suggested retarded resolution or empyema.

C O N C L U S I O N S. 
1. Suppurative pleurisy p :oduces a very definite leuco 
sytosis. This forms a very striking contrast to 
the leucocyte record in_mrous pleurisy. As in other inflammatory conditions, the leucocytosis is 
due to an increase in the poly nuclear finely granular oxyphiles. 
2. After evacuation of the pus, the leucocytosis does 
not disappear with the same rapidity as we have 
- 231 - noticed after the drainage of other abscess formations. This is largely due to the very great 
diffgculty we have in effectually draining the 
pleural cavity. 
All my cases of empyema left hospital still discharging pus from the operatior_wou,so that I was unable to follow any of them until a complete 
cure had been effected. 
3. Gross accumulations of pus occurring after an 
empyema has been opened would in all probabability he detected by regular leucocyte estimations. 
As in suppurative appendicitis imperfect drainage 
would be accompanied by an elevation of the leucocyte curve.

In none of nor cases of serous pleurisy did I obtain in-

compare these results with cases of Empyema, in which a very well marked leucocytosis is to be found. Such a 
comparison suggests to one's mind the possibility tha' 
examination of the blood would be of value in the differ 
ential diagnosis of such conditions. It is of course 
quite impossible to say what proportion of these cases of 
serous pleurisy are tuberculous. A careful investigation of these cases of serous pleurisy from the bacteriological point of view might prove of great value.

- 236 - Post Mortem revealed a small shrivelled gangrenous right 
lung, pleural cavity on that side occupied chiefly by 
airiwalls inflamed. 
At the operation several organisms were obtained from 
the foul bloody fluid drawn out from the chest by the 
exploring needle. They were as follows; - Mi crococcus Tetragenous. 
Diplococcus. 
Streptococcirg Pyogeenes. 
This case was one of great obscurity. He was suffering 
from some toxic condition, with dulness at the base of his 
right lung. The diagnosis made was pulmonary abscess, 
which was not confirmed, by the operation. When the 
pleura was opened there was a very foul odour carne out 
of the wound. There was no fluid in his pleural cavity. 
An incision was made into lung, and a tube was inserted. 
He progressed very well for some time, discharging foetid 
grumous looking fluid,through his tube, with occasional 
pieces of lung tissue. 
After discharging.a large piece of lung tissue on October 8th, he became suddenly worse, and rapidly sank.

Discharged to the Jaffray Hospital, much improved. 
There is a very definite increase of the poly nuclear 
firs ly granular oxyphiles, with almost entire absence 
of large lymphocytes. When the leucocytosis was most 
- 237 - marked the child's condition was at its worst, indeed 
during the last weeks in September its life was despaired 
of: surviving this however it gradually got better. 
The leucocyte curve steadily fell from its highest point.

This case was for a considerable time one of great difficulty. Cultivations of the blood, until a few clays before

that varied very little in character. The red corpuscles 
were between two and three million per cubic millimetre

- 239 - In contrast to the preceding case, this is of short duration, being more acute in character. It is a very se- vere form of ulcerative endocarditis, coming on after 
world infection. There was a definite history of rheumatic rever, and cardiac murmurs. Organisms gaining access 
into the blood, and corning contact with damaged valves, 
have sat up this malignant condition. In spite of the 
evident severity of his attack, the leucocytes are scarcely if at all increased. The most reasonable explanation 
of this absence of leucocytic reaction is - that the dose 
of toxic infection wasoverwhelming, and the low leucocyte 
count is to be regarded as point irg to a grave prognosis. The su ppu rat ion i in the wound was more than sufficient to produce a definite leucocytosis had the reactionary powers been sufficiently vigorous. No blood cultivations were taken, - it was regarded as a casa of Deliriun 
Tremens, and its true nature was only revealed by the 
autopsy.

- 241 - This patient never had any symptoms or physical signs of 
a pneumonia beyond her rapid breathing. I think her leu 
cocyte record, together with her subsequent progress, 
quite excludes the possibility of a pneumonia. It is 
very interesting to observe that even though the patient 
had a miscarriage, and lost a certain amount of blood, 
there should be no leucocytosis.

Rost Mortem revealed a very malignant type of Typhoid, 
ulceration is present with general peritonitis. 
This case illustrates a very well marked leucopenia, 
which often exists in Typhoid fever. According to 
Thayer, there is a leucotyosis preceding actual perforation, due to a local form of peritonitis. This condition might exist in cases of gradual perforation, but 
in a case of this kind, with malignant ulceration, where 
more than one ulcer leaked at the same time, I should 
think it very unlikely that any time could be given for 
a preliminary leucocytosis. Still it is a question 
that will be of interest to investigate.

Recovered slowly and got perfectly well. 
It will he observed that my first count taken 3l hours 
perforation is a normal one, both quantitatively and qualitatively. On the following day a very 
well marked leucocytosis is present, which is entirely 
a poly nuclear one. The peritonitis was general, though 
subacute in character. The child was very emaciated, 
and dragged on from day to day. An ice bag was kept 
Over the abdomen for about a fortnight. Operation seemed 
put of the question as the patient was extremely weak. 
It is of interest to realise that in spite of the extreme weakness of the child,a very well marked leucocy 
tosis was present, and this was well maintained to the 
end of my observations. 
1. 
- 248 - C O N C L U S I O N S. 
Uncomplicated enteric fever produces either a normal, or as is more usual, a sub normal leucocyte 
count. This fact cannot but produce the greatest 
wonder and speculation as to its true explanation. 
the 
We cannot explain why typhoid bacillus' the influenza bacillus, the tubercle bacillus, and the plasmodium malariae should entirely fail to produce 
an increase in the number of circulating white 
blood corpuscles, while most of the other less virulent organisms so readily give rise to such an increase. The fact nevertheless remains, and though 
uninterpretable by us we cannot help realising 
that this entire absence of leucocytosis in uncomplicated typhoid fever might be used as an important aid in the differential diagnosis from such 
diseases as pneumonia, scarlet fever, appendicitis 
and other abdominal inflammations. It can be 
of further value in cases of relapsing typhoid befor the rash appears, when the rising temperature 
might be explained in another way as illustrated 
in cases 12 and 13. 
In eight out of me twelve cases of uncomplicated 
typhoid the leucocyte count was less than 5000 per 
cubic millimetre. 
- 249 - 2. Enteric with complications will nive a leucocytosis in accordance with the particular complication, 
so that in estimating the leucocytes for a diagnos 
tic purpose, the presence of a complication must 
always be carefully considered.

It 
Patient passed a gall stone about the size of a hazel nut 
on October 26th, temperature fell, pain ceased. 
There is here again a moderate leucocytosis which is probably due to sl4ght cholecystitis or cholangitis. 
- 251 - Cases 2 and 3 were almost identical - pain, tenderness, 
jaundice, slight temperature. The first count in each 
shows the same degree of leucocytosis, the second a normal 
count. 
It seems to me that in such conditions as gall stone 
colic, it,would be a matter of the utmost comfort to have 
some reliable guide, apart from those we are accustomed 
to use at present, to inform us whether the inflammation 
set up by the passing stone is a serious one or not. 
How often is it not the case that surgical interference 
is not invited until a very free sepsis is established in 
the gall bladder or bile ducts. Under such conditions 
operative measures are both dangerous and difficult, whereas they are so easy and free from risk when taken sufficiently early. I am inclined to think that a careful 
leucocyte record of such attacks, would largely obviate 
that unfortunate delay in adopting surgical measures in 
septic cases, as well as add materially to the mental 
comfort of the medical attendant in simple ones. In 
the first class of case the leucocytosis would be maintained and probably increased, whereas in the latter 
it would disappear in a few days.

- 255 - GYNAECCLOGICAL. 
Mr work in the gynaecological ward was far from being as 
fruitful as I had hoped it might be. This was not because 
I met exceptions to the general results of my blood work, 
bú t simply because I had the misfortune to meet with 
cases that were very indefinite, and in which expectant 
methods were employed. There are however several interesting facts brought out in my few observations, and I believe that there is no branch of surgical work in which 
leucocyte records might prove of greater value,than in 
gynaecology. Suppurations are often obscure, deeply 
seated, and present the utmost difficulty to diagnosis, 
and under such circumstances the gynaecologist would 
heartily welcome the assistance that any clinical method 
could give him.

20. 8400 n These two cases were both diagnosed as suppurative sal - pingitis, and in both there is an entire absence of leucocytosis. Suppurative salpingitis or pus tube almost in 
variably gives rise to a very definite leucocytosis, 
very much of the same character as we get in suppurative 
appendicitis. It was not my fortune to obtain the opportunity of meeting with a single case, so that I can 
record no T ositive cases. Extra uterine gestation where 
a considerable quantity of blood has been lost, gives 
rise also to a well marked leucocytosis, but in this 
- 2-i7 - case there is diminution of the red corpuscles at the 
same time. It is always however important l bear this ,,..:.s point in mind in makin,_; a differential diagnosis.

The patient got perfectly well under expectant treatment. 
The leucocytosis is a mild one, and it will be seen that 
it falls slowly under treatment. 
It suggests to one's mind that in such cases a leucocyte record would be of interest in watching the effect cf treatment. If the curve fell to normal under 
the expectant method, operative treatment need not be 
adopted. Should the leucocytosis increase, it m ;.st be 
taken as an indication that further treatment is necessary.

The surgeon regarded this case as one of local suppurative peritonitis with pus shut off in the meshes of 
the pelvic cellular tissue. The irregular leucocytosis 
points to some suppurative condition. The operation 
revealed nothing beyond granulative tissue, and did not 
appear to benefit. her. A faecal fi stula opening in- 
;to the vaginafarmed, and she was ill for many weeks 
after the end of my obsevations, and indeed at the 
present time she is at the Jaffray Hospital. Her differential count is characteristic of an inflammatory 
- 260 - leucccytosis.

I saw this case in consultation with the practitioner. 
I examined the blood, and considering the fact that she 
had suffered all day from an attack of diarrhoea, induced cy calomel, I regarded the count as pointing more 
tc a sapraemia from retain 3d products than a salpingitis 
or a peritonitis. I advised softcuretting and flush - ing out '.^e uterus. This was done and her temperature 
was normal next day, and she made a good recovery.

Ahother case of retained products. The symptoms were 
still more indicative of severe sapraemia though it is 
impossible to draw a distinction by mere clinical examination between this and pyaemia. Finding organisms 
in the blood would of course conclusively point to 
the latter. 
It is thus very interesting to realise that though the 
symptoms were purely, of a sapraemi c nature, and very sa vere in character, that there is no leucocytosis.
