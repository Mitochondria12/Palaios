   "Anatomy Human Body Sample 1": " this work was specially designed to teach anatomy by dissection of the human body in regions or parts and thereby to promote instruction after a practical method. since the first appearance of the publication its usefulness has been tested by repeated trial  and the demand for another edition may be received as evidence of the fitness of the book for the attainment of the end in view. in this edition of my  demonstrations of anatomy no alteration has been made in the plan of the work which still consists of a system of dissections after the following method. in the examination of a region the attention of the student is directed first to its limits to the superficial prominences of bone or muscle and to the impressions that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. the different strata interposed between the surface and the bones are next examined in succession with reference particularly to the natural position of the several objects and their connections one with another so that they may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in an operation of surgery"

   "Thomas Hunt Diet Sample 28": ". now if it be so extremely difficult to determine  priori by the aid of chemistry and physiology alone what kind of diet will best subserve the wants of the body when in health i maintain  fortiori that it is if possible still more difficult in disease. and it is my firm conviction that our most judicious prescriptions in the way of medicine are frequently countervailed and rendered nugatory by our perverseness in presuming to regulate the diet by arbitrary rules. but this leads us to inquire whether nature has provided us with a dietetic instinct in disease as well as in health"

   "Thomas Hunt Diet Sample 30": ". in like manner when man is in a state of early fever his appetites are widely diverse from those of health. his thirst frequently becomes urgent if not insatiable while the very sight and smell of food is nauseating to him or if any appetite for food remain he prefers acid fruits and succulent vegetables to dry solid food"

  },
  {
   "Thomas Hunt Diet Sample 45": ". itonly remains to be observed that this rule like all other physical laws has its exceptions which exceptions when rightly considered will be found rather to prove the rule than to render it nugatory. among the afflictions to which the human system is subject none are more common in the present day than those which may be included under the general term malsthesia consisting of dis- ordered or morbid sensations often depending upon no obvious cause. the affections termed neuralgic are of this kind  and this name is given when the sensations are painfully disordered. but it often happens that the natural sensation of a part is so strangely altered as to convey an erroneous impression to the mind"

   "Thomas Hunt Diet Sample 48": ". now and then patients tell us that they are extremely fond of lobsters  or of veal or soles or walnuts or chesnuts  but that these things always make them ill. most of these cases consist of morbid sensations and form exceptions to the rule  and here reason and experience step in and we have no practical difficulty in defining the limits to which instinct may be trusted or in other words we can easily distinguish between a natural appetite and a morbid craving. but the longing is not always to be called morbid merely because the thing desired apparently disagrees with the patient"
